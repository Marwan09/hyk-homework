 Kibbeh
1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

Make the filling. In a small dry skillet over medium heat, toast pine nuts until golden brown and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Set aside the toasted pine nuts. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine butter and olive oil. When the butter has melted, reduce heat to medium and add onions. Sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ground lamb and stir with a wooden spoon to break up any clumps. Cook until lamb is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat and add toasted pine nuts, lemon juice, cinnamon, allspice, pepper, and salt. Stir to combine and adjust seasoning to taste. Set filling aside.

Make the base. Soak the bulgur for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, use a food processor to process onion quarters until finely minced. Add lamb, cinnamon, allspice, pepper, and salt and process until fairly smooth. Transfer the meat mixture to a large bowl. Fill a small bowl with cold water and a pinch of salt. Drain bulgur, then add to the meat mixture. Use your hands to knead the meat mixture together with the bulgur until smooth, about 3 minutes. Rinse your hands in the salted water occasionally to help moisten the kibbeh.

4
Butter an 8x11-inch baking dish. Rinse your hands in the salted water, then use your wet hands to divide the base mixture in half. Press half of the base mixture into the baking dish to coat the bottom.To make the process easier, pinch off small chunks of base, flatten them with your palms, and place them in the dish. The base mixture should be about ½ an inch thick.

5
Gently and evenly spread the filling mixture over the first layer of base. Top with remaining base mixture. Once you've covered the filling, moisten your index finger and use it to smooth out the surface of the kibbeh.

Bake kibbeh until golden brown, about 35 minutes.
